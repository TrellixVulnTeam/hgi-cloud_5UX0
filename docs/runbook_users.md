# Introduction

Before you continue reading, there are some terms and values you are
supposed to know. For any term, please read the [Setup Guide](setup.md),
which also contains a short glossary and other useful links.

The following is a list of values / information you need to know. If
unsure, ask to a member of the HGI team.

1. The current name-tag of the datacenter (e.g., `eta`)
2. The name-tag of the programme / team that is hosting your cluster (e.g., `hgi`)
3. The name-tag of the working environment (e.g., `dev`)
4. Your Openstack username (e.g., `ld14`)
5. The name of the deployment (e.g., `hail`)

Using a `bash`-like syntax:

```bash
datacenter="eta"
programme="hgi"
environment="dev"
os_username="ld14"
deployment_name="hail"
```

# For Users of the provisioning system

## Set yourself up in the provisioning system
```bash
bash invoke.sh user create
```

## Update your SSH keys in the provisioning system
```bash
bash invoke.sh user destroy
bash invoke.sh user create
```

* you may want to do this because you have lost / replace your keypair

## Remove yourself from the provisioning system
```bash
bash invoke.sh user destroy --yes-also-the-bucket
```

## Create your Hail cluster
```bash
bash invoke.sh hail create
```

## Scale your Hail cluster
```bash
# TODO: yet to be implemented
bash invoke.sh hail scale --spark-slaves-count 8
```

## Destroy your Hail cluster
```bash
bash invoke.sh hail destroy
```

## Find the configuration files for your hail cluster and your hail volume

There are 2 sets of configuration files:
1. For the infrastructure provisioning:
   ```
   ls -la terraform/vars/${datacenter}/${programme}/${environment}/${os_username}/
   ```
2. For the software provisioning:
   ```
   ls -la ansible/vars/${datacenter}/${programme}/${environment}/${os_username}/${deployment_name}/
   ```

## Restart the Jupyter Notebook Service

In early versions of the provisioned Notebook, there was a "Quit" button
in the upper right corner. If this button was pressed, it would shut
down the Jupyter service on your Hail master node. This button has since
been disabled, but if you are using an older version and have this
button:

1. **Do not press the "Quit" button!**

2. If you do press it, reflect on your life choices and then, to restart
   the Jupyter Notebook service, run the following command:

       ssh ${ip_address} sudo systemctl restart jupyter-notebook.service

   From a machine on which your private key exists, where
   `${ip_address}` is the IP address of your Hail master node.
