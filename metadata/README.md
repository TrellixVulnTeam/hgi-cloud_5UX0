# Metadata
This directory contains metadata for each project that this repo can manage.
Each new project **must** have its own file in this directory. The following is
an example for the project `hgi-dev`:

```bash
# The cloud provider
META_PROVIDER="openstack"
# The name-tag of the datacenter
META_DATACENTER="theta"
# The name-tag of the programme / team
META_PROGRAMME="hgi"
# The name-tag of the infrastructure's working environment
META_ENV="dev"
```
