# hgi-systems-cluster-spark

A reboot of the HGI's IaC project. This specific project has been created to
address one, simple, initial objective: the lifecycle management of a spark cluster.

# Why a reboot?

The code was not effective any more: the team was not confident with the
codebase, the building process and the infrastructure generated by the code
was missing a number of must-have features for today's infrastructures.
We chose to have a fresh start on the IaC, rather then refactoring legacy
code. This will let us choose simple and effective objectives, outline better
requirements, and design around operability from the very beginning.

# Usage

To create the infrastructure:
```
bash invoke create
```

To destroy the infrastructure:
```
bash invoke destroy
```

# Architecture
TODO: include a simple design diagram

# Design choices
TODO: write down a small paragraph about any design choice.

# Use cases
