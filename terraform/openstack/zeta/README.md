# openstack/zeta

This is the home for the configuration that is going to manage the
infrastructure in the local `OpenStack` deployment labeld as `zeta`.

# Why?

Eventually, a new local deployment of `OpenStack` will be released. The new
deployment might have major updates with incompatible protocols or APIs, therefore
it made sense to have a separate directory for the each `OpenStack` deployment
versions.
